Roles and RoleBindings
Roles
Scope: Roles are namespaced and define a set of permissions within a specific namespace.
Usage: Use Roles to grant permissions within a single namespace.
Definition: Includes apiGroups, resources, and verbs to specify what actions are allowed on which resources.
Example Permissions: get, watch, list for resources like pods.
RoleBindings
Scope: RoleBindings are also namespaced and link a Role to a user, group, or service account within a namespace.
Usage: Use RoleBindings to grant the permissions defined in a Role to specific users or groups within a namespace.
Components:
subjects: Specifies the users/groups/service accounts that the RoleBinding applies to.
roleRef: Refers to the Role that contains the permissions.
ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings
ClusterRoles
Scope: ClusterRoles are cluster-wide and define a set of permissions that apply across all namespaces.
Usage: Use ClusterRoles to grant permissions that span across multiple namespaces or the entire cluster.
Definition: Similar to Roles but can also include non-namespaced resources (e.g., nodes, persistent volumes).
Example Permissions: get, watch, list for resources like pods or nodes.
ClusterRoleBindings
Scope: ClusterRoleBindings are cluster-wide and link a ClusterRole to a user, group, or service account across the entire cluster.
Usage: Use ClusterRoleBindings to grant the permissions defined in a ClusterRole to specific users or groups cluster-wide.
Components:
subjects: Specifies the users/groups/service accounts that the ClusterRoleBinding applies to.
roleRef: Refers to the ClusterRole that contains the permissions.
Steps to Create and Bind Roles and ClusterRoles
Create Role/ClusterRole:

Define the permissions you want to grant.
Specify the apiGroups, resources, and verbs.
Create RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding:

Specify the subjects (users, groups, or service accounts).
Refer to the appropriate Role or ClusterRole.
Example Use Cases
Namespace-Specific Access:

Use Roles and RoleBindings to grant users access to resources within a specific namespace.
Example: A developer needs to manage pods in the development namespace.
Cluster-Wide Access:

Use ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings to grant users access to resources across all namespaces.
Example: An admin needs to view logs of all pods in the cluster.
