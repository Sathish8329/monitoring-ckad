containers are not istolated from host, both share same kernel, isolated using namespaces.  All processes in the container run in the host itself in their own namespace.  

docker run ubuntu sleep 3600
you will see user root but sleep 3600 and docker in different pid ie process id
ps aux

by default docker run root user, it will run as a root user.

docker run --user=1000 ubuntu sleep 3600
now it will run in the user named 1000
or you can run like
FROM UBUNTU
USER 1000


docker run --cap-add MAC_ADMIN ubuntu - to add previlages to the user
docker run --cap-drop MAC_ADMIN ubuntu - t0 drop previlates to the user
  docker run --privileged ubuntu - for alll privileges.
